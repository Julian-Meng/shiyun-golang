# 诗云 / Poetry Cloud — HANDOFF

> Read this first, then `docs/`. This is a working, verified prototype. The engine + data +
> interfaces are stable; the `src/three` + `src/ui` frontend is a replaceable prototype.

Inspired by 刘慈欣《诗云》 + 博尔赫斯《巴别图书馆》: a roamable 3D galaxy where every real poet
is a star and the void between them is **every possible poem**, pulled out on click — *computed,
never stored* (every poem ⇄ a big-integer index, bijectively).

---

## ⚠ Canonical base — READ BEFORE BRANCHING (worktree hand-off)

**`main` is the canonical, up-to-date branch.** Cut your worktree FROM `main`, and when you finish,
**fast-forward `main` onto your branch** (`git checkout main && git merge --ff-only <your-branch> &&
git push origin main`) so the NEXT agent starts from your work — not a stale commit.

*Real failure that motivated this (do not repeat):* a session left all its advanced work on a
feature branch (`claude/flamboyant-cannon-…`) and never advanced `main`. The next worktree was cut
from the stale `main` (8 commits behind) and silently lost 赠诗 / 自由格式 / bloom / 模糊搜索 /
新诗诗人 …, and poem loading was dead. **If `main`'s tip is not the latest verified work, the
hand-off is broken — fix `main` first.** Check with `git log --oneline --all --graph`.

**Heavy data is git-ignored** — `public/data/poems/` (235 MB) and `public/data/lines/` (791 MB).
A fresh worktree has NEITHER, so "click a poet → 载入作品…" hangs and 诗句 search finds nothing.
Provision before you start, one of two ways:
- regenerate: `node --max-old-space-size=4096 pipeline/build-data.mjs` (needs the corpora), **or**
- (fast, same machine) junction them from a worktree that already has them — PowerShell:
  `cmd /c mklink /J "<new>\public\data\poems" "<existing>\public\data\poems"` (and `…\lines`).

**Backups:** private GitHub repo `github.com/Cohenjikan/shiyun` (all branches); local all-branches
bundle at `C:\Users\Cohen\Desktop\shiyun-ALL-branches-backup.bundle` (restore: `git clone <bundle>`).

---

## 1. Run it (works out of the box — data is already in `public/data`)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # vite → http://localhost:5173
npm test           # vitest: 57 tests (47 engine + 6 GPU-pick + 4 engineApi compose round-trip)
npm run deploy:build  # build + precompress for a static host (see docs/DEPLOY.md) — Range-safe
npm run build      # tsc --noEmit && vite build  (the real verify gate)
npm run typecheck
```

Node 24, npm 11. Windows. Stack: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + @react-three/fiber 8 /
drei 9 / three 0.169 + zustand 5. **100% static, no backend — never add one** (it's the one
thing that breaks the hosting model; all index math + render is client-side).

---

## 2. What works (all verified this session)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| **Index engine** (`src/engine/engine.ts`) | Babel base-N + 格律 mixed-radix-product rank/unrank, nested dual index, reversible BigInt Feistel, + **自由 variable-length catalog** + **prefixIndex (半编号)** + **编号反查 (pullByIndex)**. **44/44 tests**. First char = most-significant digit. **The 全集编号 IS a true 正序 rank** (`babelRank` = the poem's lexicographic position over the freq-ordered 字库) — `babelUnrank` reverses it (`engineApi.pullByIndex`), so 诗⇄编号 is an exact bijection (NOT a hash; the Feistel scatter is used only for spatial layout, never for the displayed number). |
| **Real data** | Werneror corpus + modern 新诗 → **29,808 poets · 857,877 poems · 字库 N=12,877** (Simplified). In `public/data/`. |
| **Real 格律** | 平水韵 lexicon (charlesix59, MIT + pinyin-pro tail): 平 5758 / 仄 7119 / 30 韵部. `公式 格律 toggle` produces tone-valid, rhyming poems. |
| **Galaxy** | Realistic spiral: **~166k two-layer particles** (soft dim dust + sparse bright arm stars) + a **dense particle bulge** on an exponential profile (no hard glow-sprite → smooth core), **Gaussian point falloff** `exp(-4.5d²)` (continuous nebulosity, not dots), value-noise clumping + dust gaps, HII knots, warm-core→blue-arm colour, **`UnrealBloom`** for HDR glow. **画质·高/低 toggle** (`store.quality`) halves counts + drops bloom for weak GPUs. |
| **Poets woven into the arms** | `poetPosition`: gaussian radial spread (blends dynasty colours) + concentrated onto the **same 4 spiral arms** as the backdrop (`armDev ×0.45`) → colour reads as a gradient ALONG the arms, not concentric rings; gaussian Y-thickness swells toward the centre (depth). **Famous poets** (`famousPoets.ts`) → 2.4× size + gilded glow (李白/杜甫/苏轼/徐志摩… are visible landmark "明星"). |
| **Void-pull markers** | Small twinkling captured-light spots (not giant balls), lifecycle: fade-in, cap 20 ALIVE (oldest flickers out + self-destructs), distance-culled; a void click **glide-focuses** the camera on the captured point. `three/PulledStars`. |
| **赠诗 arcs** | Soft **curved Bézier**, control points pulled toward the centre → **bundled flows**; a shader sends a **pulse giver→receiver** (flow direction); endpoint-faded; ambient = weight≥3, selected poet = clean ego-net. |
| **编号反查 (reverse)** | Paste a 全集编号 + 诗体 → `pullByIndex` reconstructs the exact poem (full numbers, copy buttons), and reports if it's a **real** poem (loop closure: 静夜思's 编号 → "正好对应李白《静夜思》"). |
| **Permalinks** | Address bar stays shareable: `#a=<poetId>` / `#p=<form>.<index>` (`state/permalink.ts`); 🔗 分享 buttons; restore on load. |
| **Product-grade UI** | Elegant 楷/宋 serif (`--serif`) for poem text; gradient cards + gold accent rules. |
| **诗句 content search** | ANY line (not just openings) — `疑是地上霜 → 静夜思` — via an all-lines inverted index (`lines/`, 256 shards). |
| **Interaction** | 6-DOF fly cam + speed HUD; **O(1) GPU colour-ID pick** (`three/gpuPick.ts` — poet index → offscreen buffer, read the cursor pixel; replaced the old O(29,808)/hover CPU scan): click a star → poet, click void → random poem; names only on hover/select. |
| **Per-poet egress (#12)** | Clicking a poet HTTP **Range**-fetches just that poet's slice of its `poems/{bucket}.json` (a few KB) via the byte-offset sidecar `poems/{bucket}.idx.json`, not the whole ~0.9 MB bucket. Whole-file stays valid JSON → transparent fallback when the sidecar is absent or the host ignores Range (200 not 206). `load.ts::loadPoetPoems`. |
| **Search** | Author search → fly-to → poet's real poems + each poem's 全集编号. |
| **Filters compose** | 诗体 × **常用字** (top-2500 freq chars, avoids 生僻乱码) × **格律**. e.g. 格律+常用字 → "思伦要锁馆/窟置右黎刍/肆昧家谐变/霜辉化铁驹" (valid + readable). |
| **Dynasty filter** | 15-dynasty legend (先秦→当代) + presets (全部/主要/唐宋). |
| **自由格式 / 词** (5th form) | A separate variable-length catalog: alphabet = 字库 N real glyphs + a block of W≈N/5 "break" glyphs (radix N+W, length 28). Random pulls split into 词-like variable lines (~4.6 行 × ~5 字). Own 自由目录编号; composes with 常用字; never 格律. `engine.freeUnrank/freeRank/splitFree`. |
| **半编号 (half-index)** | 诗句 tab also yields the **半编号** — the high-order address the opening line pins (verified: 静夜思's 全集编号 *starts with* the 5-char 半编号). Pure, always-on: `engineApi.halfIndex/halfIndexAuto`. |
| **赠诗网络** | HUD 赠诗 toggle → **4,849 dedication edges** (寄/赠/和/次韵… title-parsed; greedy-longest name match + ~250-entry 字号 alias table — 少陵→杜甫, 子瞻→苏轼, 香山→白居易; one edge per 兼寄 recipient). 元稹→白居易, 苏辙→苏轼, 黄庭坚→苏轼…. Committed `gifts.json` (~126 KB). `three/GiftLines`. |
| **新诗 / modern** | yuxqiu/modern-poetry contemporary set (Apache-2.0) folded in: +4,494 free-verse poems / +508 poets (徐志摩《再别康桥》, 海子, 北岛, 顾城, 戴望舒…). Free verse → form `other`; 民国→近现代 else 当代; their lines are searchable. |

Three pull modes to feel the project: plain random「牛蝛茙漂綵」→ 格律「趰㵎憣烔岆」→ 格律+常用字
「思伦要锁馆」; plus 自由格式 for 词-like变行, and the 诗句 tab to find a real poem from one line.

## 3. Docs map (read in this order)

- [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — layers, what's stable vs replaceable, data flow.
- [docs/ENGINE_API.md](docs/ENGINE_API.md) — engine + engineApi surface, invariants, MSB convention.
- [docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md](docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md) — static-asset schemas, corpus, dynasty taxonomy + normalization map.
- [docs/FRONTEND_GUIDE.md](docs/FRONTEND_GUIDE.md) — **rebuild contract**: the 4 stable interfaces a new frontend uses (load.ts / engineApi / poetPosition / store), interaction model, locked direction notes.
- [docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md) — how the data + lexicon are built.
- [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) — static deploy (nginx + brotli + the poems/ Range gotcha).

`src/data/contract.ts` is the typed source-of-truth for every data asset.

---

## 4. Data & regeneration

`public/data/` **tracked in git**: `charset.json` (38 KB), `poets.index.json` (2.5 MB),
`lexicon.json` (147 KB), `gifts.json` (~126 KB, 赠诗 edges), `manifest.json`.
**git-ignored** (regenerate as below): `poems/*.json` (235 MB, 256 buckets, real poem text)
and `lines/*.json` (791 MB, 256 shards, the **all-lines** content-search index — every line,
not just openings; renamed from `firstline/`). So a fresh `git worktree` has the galaxy +
author search + 格律 + 自由格式 + 半编号 + **赠诗网络** working; only "click a poet → read their
poems" and "诗句 search → the real poem" need the two heavy dirs regenerated.

**Corpora already cloned on this machine** (external, not in the repo):
- `C:\corpus\Werneror-Poetry` — all-dynasties corpus (MIT). Used by `pipeline/build-data.mjs`.
- `C:\corpus\modern-poetry` — yuxqiu/modern-poetry 新诗 set (Apache-2.0). Also read by `build-data.mjs`.
- `C:\corpus\Pingshui_Rhyme.json` — 平水韵 (charlesix59, MIT). Used by `pipeline/build-lexicon.mjs`.

Regenerate (scripts now write into *this* project's `public/data` via relative paths):
```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 pipeline/build-data.mjs     # charset + poets.index + poems + lines/ + gifts
node pipeline/build-lexicon.mjs                            # lexicon.json (needs opencc-js, pinyin-pro — devDeps)
```
`build-data.mjs` now also reads the modern corpus + carries the expanded ~250-entry `GIFT_ALIAS`
字号 table. When 字库 N changes, `lexicon.json` must be rebuilt too (it indexes 平/仄 by glyph).

---

## 5. Verifying changes (important gotchas)

- **The verify gate is `npm run build` (tsc) + `npm test`.** Keep the 47 engine tests green.
- **The headless preview GPU (swiftshader) CANNOT screenshot the dense additive galaxy** — it
  times out (not a crash; the page is alive). Verify visuals on a real GPU, or drive the DOM
  with the preview MCP's `preview_eval` (read `.poem-panel` / `.poet-panel` text, dispatch
  synthetic clicks). Reduce galaxy point counts in `src/three/Galaxy.tsx` if you need a shot.
- **Synthetic clicks fired right after page load don't stick** (pre-hydration) — click, wait a
  tick, re-verify.
- **Rapid HMR edits** can trip the r3f ErrorBoundary transiently — restart the dev server for a
  clean mount; the production build is the source of truth.

---

## 6. Remaining work (next, roughly in priority)

**DONE — 行星 / poem-orbits feature (latest; verified: build + 57/57 + DOM e2e on 5199; orbit *aesthetics* need a real-GPU pass):**
- ✅ **Poems are now first-class objects orbiting their poet** — resolves the "click star=poet / click void=poem"
  asymmetry the user flagged. New **`three/positions.ts`** holds the shared deterministic layout: `poetPosition` (moved
  here from PoetStars, re-exported for back-compat) + `poemPosition`/`poemOffset` — a poem sits on a golden-angle,
  area-uniform disc around its poet star, system radius ∝ √poemCount (李白/杜甫 = a full system; a 1-poem poet = a
  single satellite). The SAME function backs render + 目录 locate + 诗句 search, so a poem-planet is at ONE canonical spot.
- ✅ **`three/PoemOrbits.tsx`** renders planets; two modes via the HUD **行星** toggle (`store.showAllPoems`, like 赠诗,
  default OFF — 兼顾高/普通机器):
    • OFF (普通机器): only the SELECTED poet's poems orbit (≤~3.6k pts, brighter + twinkling) — an on-demand 彩蛋 on poet click.
    • ON (高性能机器): EVERY poet's poems orbit — ONE 857,877-point Points layer (dim/small), built once when toggled on,
      disposed when off. Positions need NO new asset (computed from poets.index poemCount; poem TEXT still lazy-loads on click).
  The layer spins with the shared `galaxySpin.angle` (locked to PoetStars). Verified it builds + renders w/o error in the
  headless preview; **fps + orbit radius/brightness are the user's real-GPU call** (knobs: `PoemOrbits` `planetMaterial`
  args + `positions.poemSystemRadius`).
- ✅ **目录定位** — every poem row in PoetPanel has a 🛸定位 button → flies to that poem's planet + lights a flare
  (`store.pulseAt` = a flare WITHOUT changing selection, so the panel stays open). Works for the 八大家 and everyone.
- ✅ **诗句 search → planet** — a 诗句 hit flies to the EXACT poem-planet in the poet's system (not just the poet centre)
  + flares it (`SearchPanel.goHit`).
- ⏭ **NOT done: clicking a planet to open the poem** — needs a SEPARATE pick geometry + its own size gate (the poet
  picker's `sz<4.4px` discard would eat small satellites; can't just reuse the poet picker). Deferred — locate/search
  cover navigation. Next obvious step for this feature.

**DONE — UX iteration round 5 (verified: build + 57/57 + DOM mount; centre confirmed 够散/漂亮 by the user on a real GPU):**
- ✅ **造诗 placeholder simplified** — the long hint clipped in the 320px panel; placeholder is now 「粘贴整首诗…」 and the
  拼音/标点 detail moved to the (wrapping) dim helper line so no info is lost. (`SearchPanel`.)
- ✅ **Centre cross dissolved HARDER (rounds 3–4 were still "太保守")** — `poetPosition` centreBlur range 0.42→0.5 and
  coreScat 0.15→**0.22** (range 0.4→0.5): the bright POET cross (poets are the ×2.3 stars → the dominant shape) fills into
  a round disc. Galaxy backdrop disk also gets full azimuthal randomisation + absolute in-plane core scatter + a
  noise-floor lift toward the core (kills the inter-arm dark wedges); BULGE 42k→**64k**, wider (cap 0.34R→0.42R), modest
  brightness-floor lift. *(Knobs: `PoetStars.tsx` coreScat `0.22` + centreBlur `0.5`; `Galaxy.tsx` disk `cb`/`coreFill` + BULGE.)*
- ✅ **Fixed dev port** — `vite.config` `server.port:5199 strictPort` so a sibling worktree's stale server can't silently
  shadow the preview (`.claude/launch.json` already has shiyun-gpupick on 5199).

### ✅ FIXED this round — Range egress was DORMANT, now LIVE
`manifest.poemSidecar:true` but `public/data/poems/*.idx.json` sidecars were **ABSENT** (the committed data predated the
sidecar pass), so `loadPoetPoems` fell through to a whole-bucket (~0.9 MB) fetch on **every** poet click. **Fix:**
`pipeline/build-sidecars.mjs` (`npm run build:sidecars`) re-emits each `poems/{bucket}.json` canonically + its byte-offset
sidecar in one pass (same logic as `build-data.mjs::writeBucket`; no corpus needed, ~seconds). Verified live on 5199:
`/data/poems/00.idx.json` is JSON; a poet Range-fetch → `206 content-range: bytes 12-9787/890706` (9.7 KB of 890 KB,
≈98.9% egress saved), slice parses to that poet's poems. Sidecars are git-ignored data, so **re-run `npm run build:sidecars`
on any fresh worktree** (or it falls back to whole-bucket). This is the prerequisite for the orbiting-poems "cheap per-poet" path.

**DONE — UX iteration round 4 (verified: build + 57/57 + e2e DOM, GPU-pick after a clean restart):**
- ✅ **造诗 grid input fixed (was the big bug)** — the fixed-form grid was per-cell `<input maxLength=2>`
  that kept only the last char → IME (拼音) and multi-char paste were impossible. Now ONE normal input
  drives the grid; it keeps only 汉字 (`hanChars`, drops pinyin/标点/latin) and the grid cells are
  read-only DISPLAY divs. Paste 「床前明月光,疑是地上霜,举头望ab明月…」 → grid fills 床前明月光…故乡,
  81-位 编号. (`SearchPanel`.)
- ✅ **自由 punctuation filter** — 自由 now splits on newlines OR 标点/空白 and keeps only 汉字, so pasting
  「轻轻的我走了,正如我轻轻的来,…」 (commas, no Enter) splits into clean lines. ("只识别文字本身".)
- ✅ **Centre dissolved further** — `poetPosition` adds a strong ABSOLUTE in-plane x/z scatter that peaks
  at the core and fades by t≈0.4 (on top of the round-3 azimuthal `centerBlur`), so the centre reads as a
  diffuse round cloud, not a concentrated shape. *(Tune `coreScat` 0.15 on a real GPU.)*
- ✅ **PoetPanel rows no longer fold** — `.pi-row` is a `<div>` (was a `<button>` nesting the copy
  `<button>` — invalid HTML, caused the fold); long titles wrap in a `flex:1; min-width:0` column while the
  form badge + 复制编号 stay `flex:none; white-space:nowrap` (the button was wrapping to two lines).
- ✅ **Search panel docked LEFT** (`top:64px; left:20px`) so it never covers the centre crosshair / 定位.

**DONE — UX iteration round 3 (verified: build + 57/57 + e2e DOM, GPU-pick 6/6 after a clean restart):**
- ✅ **Round centre (less obvious shape)** — the bright central CROSS was the POET stars: near the core the
  4 spiral arms converge into an X. `poetPosition` now spreads poets fully azimuthally near the centre
  (`centerBlur`, strong at the core → 0 by t≈0.42) so the core reads as a ROUND bulge blended into the
  diffuse galaxy haze (= the visual-fusion ask). Arms stay intact further out. *(Tune on a real GPU.)*
- ✅ **Filter tabs no longer wrap** — `.stab` is `flex:1; white-space:nowrap`; panel 280→320px (造诗/朝代
  were breaking to two lines).
- ✅ **朝代 全部 is a toggle** — when all dynasties are shown the button reads **全不选** (deselect all);
  when some are hidden it reads **全部** (show all). (`SearchPanel`, `showOnly([])` hides all.)
- ✅ **造诗 自由 example** = 再别康桥's opening 5 lines (was an English/Claude example).
- ✅ **造诗 grid feedback** — a cell whose char is outside the 字库 turns red (`inCharset` → `.cell.bad`),
  so you see WHY the 编号 isn't computing.
- ✅ **诗人 search ignores digit/latin queries** — typing "1"/"2" used to surface the corpus's same-name
  disambiguation suffixes (张生1/张生2 …, only 13 such names + one junk "666"); now a non-Han query returns
  nothing. (`load.ts::searchPoets`; the names are a corpus artifact, left as-is — they ARE distinct poets.)
- ✅ **隐藏界面 moved into the HUD top bar** (was overlapping the bottom speed readout). Still + the H hotkey.
- ✅ **First-run onboarding** (`ui/Onboarding.tsx`) — a 3-step skippable guide, shown ONCE per browser
  (`localStorage shiyun_onboarded_v1`; clearing site data shows it again). Pure client-side.
- ✅ **Deploy kit** (`deploy/nginx.conf` + `deploy/precompress.mjs` + [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md),
  `npm run deploy:build`) — static host, brotli/gzip for assets but **poems/*.json served RAW** so the
  per-poet HTTP Range slice stays valid (the one deploy gotcha). lines/ compress normally.
- ✅ **Compose round-trip tests** — `engineApi.test.ts` (4): grid `textBabelIndex`→`pullByIndex` and 自由
  `anyTextIndex`→`pullByIndex("ziyou")` reproduce the exact poem; `inCharset`; rejects wrong-length input.
- **CONSULTED, not built:** mobile/touch (PM4 — feasible, deferred to next agent; see notes); narrative
  guided-tours (PM5 — dropped, too much copywriting); same-pass poet/decoration draw (dev — the visual
  fusion goal is met by `centerBlur`; the literal single-draw merge stays optional). 内嵌 share-card +
  find-real "奇迹时刻" (PM2/PM3 — approved, not yet built).

**DONE — UX iteration round 2 (verified: build + 53/53 + e2e DOM):**
- ✅ **造诗 (compose) tab** — the intuitive forward direction: pick a form → for 五/七绝/律 a **fill-in
  grid** of single-char cells, for **自由** a textarea (回车换行), and the engine reports the catalog
  编号 as you type (`textBabelIndex` / `anyTextIndex`) — no number-guessing. A `填字→编号 / 凭编号→诗`
  toggle keeps the old reverse lookup. It even flags when your poem is a REAL corpus poem (`findReal`).
  e2e: 静夜思 grid → 81-位 全集编号; `你/我/爱世界/…` → `你，我，爱世界，…。` + 102-位 自由编号.
- ✅ **Enter to act** — 诗句 / 诗人 inputs fly to / open the top hit on Enter.
- ✅ **UI consolidation + screenshot mode** — the floating dynasty legend is gone; it's now the **朝代
  tab** inside the one search panel (collapsible via ▴/▾). A corner **隐藏界面** button + the **H** hotkey
  hide ALL overlay UI for clean screenshots (`store.uiHidden`, `App` keydown). 
- ✅ **PoetPanel = title drawer / accordion** — shows poem **titles** only (50/page, 显示更多), each with a
  lazy **复制编号**; click a title to expand its content + full 编号. The (large-BigInt) 编号 is computed
  **lazily per poem** (`idxCache` ref) on expand/copy — not for the whole list. Much lighter + cleaner.
- ✅ **Diffuse galaxy core** — the central bulge is now a wider, jittered, noise-clumped, **softer/dimmer**
  particle cloud (+ a stronger smooth halo) so the centre reads as blurred, disordered white haze (real-
  galaxy core) instead of a regular dot-ball; the ORDERED poet/arm layer outside carries the map's logic.
  `Galaxy.tsx` bulge params — *tune on a real GPU.*
- ✅ **Void-pull marker is findable** — a fresh pull now **flashes large + bright** (like a nearby
  decoration star) the instant you click, then shrinks/dims to the quiet marker (`PulledStars` `aFlare`
  size-flare + brighter birth); 定位虚空 reuses it. The misleading centre **crosshair sprite was removed**
  (it conflicted with the real cursor — picking is at the cursor, not screen centre).

**DONE — GPU-pick + Range-fetch session (verified: build + 53/53 + e2e DOM on a real GPU):**
- ✅ **GPU colour-ID picking (#0, top priority)** — `three/gpuPick.ts`. Each poet's index is colour-encoded
  into an `aPickColor` vertex attribute (shared on the PoetStars geometry, so the dynasty-filter aSize
  writes exclude hidden poets from picks for free). On a hover/click the picker renders ONLY an n×n window
  of the poet field around the cursor (`camera.setViewOffset`) into a tiny offscreen RT, reads the pixels
  back, and decodes the nearest-to-centre non-background pixel → the poet in **O(1)**. Replaced the
  O(29,808)/hover CPU scan + apparent-size heuristic in `FlyControls.screenPick` (now a one-liner calling
  `pickTargets.pick`). A vertex-shader gate (`sz < uGate`, == the old apparent≥2.2 CSS-px gate) keeps the
  void between stars pull-able; depthTest keeps the front-most star per pixel. **Clickability is now
  decoupled from brightness**, so the decoration can be brightened toward true fusion without breaking
  clicks (the next visual step — see below). Pure helpers (`encodePickColor`/`nearestPoetIndex`) have 6
  vitest cases; a DEV-only `window.__shiyunPickTest(i)` round-trips a projected poet through the GPU path
  (verified 10/10 on a real GPU: 陆游/王世贞/屈大均/刘克庄…).
- ✅ **Per-poet Range fetch (#12, egress)** — `pipeline/build-data.mjs` now writes each `poems/{bucket}.json`
  as ONE valid JSON object PLUS a byte-offset sidecar `poems/{bucket}.idx.json` (`{id:[off,len]}`, built in
  the same pass so offsets always match the bytes). `load.ts::loadPoetPoems` HTTP **Range**-fetches just the
  poet's slice (the slice is itself valid JSON → `JSON.parse` directly), caching per-poet. Falls back to the
  whole bucket when the sidecar is absent (old data) or the host returns 200 not 206. `manifest.poemSidecar`
  gates the attempt. Verified on the vite dev server: `206`, `content-range: bytes 72297-1230612/2068787`
  for 苏轼, slice parsed to all 3596 poems (≈44–99% egress saved depending on the poet's share of its bucket).
- ✅ **Cleanups** — deleted the orphan `engineApi.anyTextReverse` (编号反查·自由 uses `pullByIndex("ziyou",…)`);
  `PoetPanel` now memoizes its rows + the (large-BigInt) 全集/自由编号 in a `useMemo` keyed on `[poems, focus]`
  so a long-新诗 `anyTextIndex` (O(n²) rank) runs once per poet load, not every render.

**DONE — 自由-merge / gravity-differential session (verified: build + 47/47 + e2e DOM):**
- ✅ **自由 ≡ ONE arbitrary-length catalog** — merged the former fixed-28 自由 AND 任意长 into a
  single bijective base-(N+1) catalog over (字库 ∪ line-break) (`engine.anyRank/anyUnrank`). It now
  backs 自由 generation (词-like via M+W sampling, breaks collapsed to the unified break so it
  round-trips), 编号反查·自由 (any number → a poem; always in-range), 新诗/古体 自由编号 (PoetPanel),
  and permalinks. The separate 任意长 UI is gone. e2e verified: 徐志摩《雪花的快乐》→ 764-digit
  自由编号 → 编号反查·自由 → EXACT same poem. (`engineApi` ziyou paths; `freeRank/freeUnrank/...`
  stay in `engine.ts` + tests but are no longer used by the app.)
- ✅ **Backdrop differential + gravity illusion** — `galaxySpin.decorAngle` (DECOR_RATE 0.019)
  turns the backdrop FASTER than the poet layer (`angle`, SPIN_RATE 0.012). With 引力 ON the camera
  co-rotates with the POETS (frozen → clickable) while the diffuse haze keeps flowing past → the
  galaxy still looks like it's spinning (no rigid freeze). Also a gentle differential when 引力 OFF.

**DONE — fusion / gravity / 任意长编号 session (verified: build + 47/47 + DOM):**
- ✅ **Star fusion** — the backdrop is now mostly diffuse haze (DUST 90k→120k) with few, dim,
  small decoration STARS (34k→9k); poets brightened (×1.9→×2.3). The bright DISCRETE points you
  fly past are predominantly clickable poets, not "invalid" decoration. `Galaxy.tsx`. *(Still
  tunable — if it reads too sparse, raise STARS / DUST.)*
- ✅ **No more wall** — `poetPosition` adds in-plane x/z scatter (pow 2.2 × 0.22·r). `PoetStars.tsx`.
- ✅ **Heavier galaxy** — bloom 0.85→1.4 (intensity) + radius 0.85 (`App.tsx`); `GALAXY.THICKNESS`
  0.07→0.11 (less razor-flat). *(Tradeoff: rotation is rigid/uniform — restoring differential spin
  would re-introduce the layer mismatch; left rigid on purpose. Tune THICKNESS/bloom on a real GPU.)*
- ✅ **引力 (gravity) toggle** (default ON) — inside the galaxy sphere (<1.15·R) FlyControls orbits
  the camera WITH the spin (same Δ/frame) + turns the heading, so stars hold still on screen and
  stay clickable. `store.gravity`, HUD 引力, `FlyControls`. Outside → watch it turn.
- ✅ **任意长编号** — `engine.anyRank/anyUnrank`: a bijective base-(N+1) numeration over (字库 ∪
  {line-break}) gives EVERY variable-length poem (新诗/古体) a reversible 全集编号 (they had none).
  `engineApi.anyTextIndex` (reverse via `pullByIndex("ziyou",…)`); PoetPanel shows a 诗云编号 for `other`
  poems; 编号反查 has a **任意长/自由** mode. +3 tests. *(The standalone `anyTextReverse` was later deleted
  as an orphan — `pullByIndex` covers reverse.)*
- ✅ **Long lines wrap** — 自由/词/任意长 poems wrap (`.poem-line.wrap`) instead of clipping.

**DONE — rotation-merge + locate session (verified: build + 44/44 + DOM):**
- ✅ **One unified galaxy spin** (`galaxyParams.galaxySpin` + `advanceSpin`/`spinXZ`/`unspinXZ`).
  The backdrop used to spin in its own shader (with an x/z reflection) while poets/arcs/markers
  never rotated → layers wound against each other. Now Galaxy points, the PoetStars group, the
  赠诗 `GiftLines` object, and the void markers ALL rotate by one shared `rotation.y`, advanced
  once/frame in Galaxy. CPU side (`screenPick`, fly-to, void-click) converts LOCAL↔WORLD with
  `spinXZ`/`unspinXZ`, so picking/labels/markers stay aligned as it turns.
- ✅ **Void click no longer moves the camera** (removed the inaccurate glide-focus); the marker
  gets a **bright birth flare → hold → linear settle** to a quiet base, kept SMALL (brightness,
  not size — bloom does the glow). `PulledStars.tsx`.
- ✅ **定位虚空 (fixed-coordinate locate)** — 编号反查 + 半编号 get a "🛸 定位虚空" button that flies
  to the index's ONE canonical void point (`engineApi.pulledFromIndex → pointForBabelIndex`) and
  lights the star with the flare marker. A number / opening is now a *place*. `SearchPanel.tsx`.
- ✅ **Pick perf** — hoisted `cos/sin` out of the 29,808-poet `screenPick` loop (was a per-poet
  `spinXZ` → 29k×2 trig per hover). `FlyControls.tsx`.

**DONE — galaxy/features session** (all verified — `npm run build` + 44/44 tests + browser DOM checks):
1. ✅ **Galaxy realism** — Gaussian point falloff `exp(-4.5d²)` (continuous nebulosity, not
   dots); ~166k particles in 3 populations (DUST + arm STARS + a dense particle **BULGE**
   replacing the old hard glow-sprite → smooth core); exponential-disk radius, value-noise
   clumping + dust gaps, HII knots, warm-core→blue-arm colour; `UnrealBloom` via
   `@react-three/postprocessing` v2.19 (**new dep**). `src/three/Galaxy.tsx`.
2. ✅ **Quality toggle** — HUD 画质·高/低 (`store.quality`); 低 halves galaxy counts
   (~166k→~59k) and disables bloom (`App.tsx`). For weak GPUs.
3. ✅ **Poets woven into the arms** — `PoetStars.tsx poetPosition`: gaussian radial spread
   blends dynasty colours; `armDev ×0.45` concentrates poets onto the **same 4 spiral arms** as
   the backdrop (colour = gradient ALONG arms, not concentric rings); gaussian Y-thickness swells
   toward centre. **Famous poets** (`src/data/famousPoets.ts`, now incl. modern) → 2.4× size +
   gilded-glow landmarks.
4. ✅ **Void-pull markers** (`PulledStars.tsx`, full rewrite) — small twinkling captured-light
   spots (not giant balls); lifecycle fade-in, cap 20 ALIVE (oldest flickers out + self-destructs),
   distance-cull. `store.Pull` has an id; `MAX_PULLS=24`. *(Later session: the void-click
   glide-focus was REMOVED — clicking the void now lights the star in place without a camera move;
   markers gained the birth flare. See the rotation-merge block above.)*
5. ✅ **赠诗 arcs** (`GiftLines.tsx`) — cubic Bézier, control points pulled toward centre →
   **bundled flows** (poor-man's hierarchical edge bundling, `BUNDLE=0.3`); a custom shader sends
   a soft pulse giver→receiver (flow direction); endpoint-faded; ambient = weight≥3, selecting a
   poet draws a clean ego-network.
6. ✅ **编号反查 reverse search** (3rd search tab) — `engineApi.pullByIndex(form, indexStr)` unranks
   a number back to its poem; full untruncated numbers everywhere + copy buttons
   (`src/ui/CopyButton.tsx`); loop closure: checks the line index + full text and reports if the
   number is a **real** poem.
7. ✅ **Permalinks** (`src/state/permalink.ts`) — `#a=<poetId>` / `#p=<form>.<index>`; 🔗 分享
   buttons in the poem + poet panels; `engineApi.pulledFromIndex` rebuilds a poem from a link; App
   restores on load.
8. ✅ **Product-grade poem UI** — `--serif` (楷/宋 stack) for poem text; gradient cards + gold accent.
9. ✅ **Any-line content search** — pipeline now indexes **EVERY** line (not just openings) →
   `public/data/lines/{bucket}.json` (256 shards, ~791 MB, git-ignored — renamed from
   `firstline/`). 疑是地上霜 → 李白《静夜思》 (a non-first line) now works; `load.ts` reads `lines/`.
10. ✅ **Modern 新诗 poets** — imported yuxqiu/modern-poetry (Apache-2.0, `C:/corpus/modern-poetry`):
    +4,494 free-verse poems / +508 poets (徐志摩, 海子, 北岛, 顾城, 戴望舒…). Free verse → form
    `other`; 民国→近现代 else 当代; their lines are searchable.
11. ✅ **字号 alias table** expanded to ~250 entries (~120 poets) in `build-data.mjs GIFT_ALIAS` →
    4,849 赠诗 edges (少陵→杜甫, 子瞻→苏轼, 香山→白居易…).

**Still TODO (recommended order for the NEXT agent):**
1. **True visual fusion (now UNBLOCKED by GPU picking)** — picking no longer depends on poets being the
   brightest discrete points, so the decoration brightness-juggling in `Galaxy`/`PoetStars` (DUST 120k /
   dim STARS 9k / poets ×2.3) can be rebalanced so poets sit in / among the decoration and the cloud reads
   as one continuous field. *Must be tuned on a real GPU* (headless can't screenshot the additive galaxy).
   Optional next step: draw poets in the SAME pass as the decoration (the pick buffer keeps them clickable).
   Start by raising `Galaxy` STARS/brightness and lowering the poet `×2.3` until the seam disappears.
2. **Deploy** — static build → `shiyun.<domain>` subdomain, nginx `brotli_static`, precompress assets.
   See DATA_CONTRACT.md §deploy notes. **Range matters here**: the per-poet fetch needs the host to honour
   byte ranges on `poems/*.json` (nginx/most static CDNs do; `brotli_static` serving a `.br` still supports
   ranges on the precompressed file). No backend.
3. **Polish** — thicker 赠诗 lines (`Line2`/`meshline` — current arcs are 1px, WebGL `lineWidth` cap);
   无名氏 collapse; modern-poet **dynasty refinement** (date table to split 近现代/当代 more finely than
   民国-only); pre-compute the per-bucket `poems/*.idx.json` into a single sidecar if 256 tiny fetches add up.
4. **True round-trip void coords** — `pullAt` (click→`indexFromPoint`) and the locate/permalink map
    (`pointForBabelIndex`) are NOT inverses, so clicking a located poem's exact spot won't reproduce
    it. A clean bijection over continuous space ↔ a 10⁸²-index catalog is impossible at float
    precision; either accept it (clicks = local noise sampling; locate = the canonical address) or
    document it in-UI. Not a bug — a design choice to make explicit.

### Residual watch items (low priority)
- **装饰差速莫尔条纹** — the backdrop turns FASTER than the poet layer (`DECOR_RATE 0.019` vs
  `SPIN_RATE 0.012`, `galaxyParams.ts`). It's a deliberate "still spinning" cue and reads as nebula flow
  because the backdrop is dim haze. If a real GPU ever shows ghosting / a second arm set, lower
  `DECOR_RATE` toward `SPIN_RATE`. (GPU picking already keeps poets clickable regardless of this drift.)
- **256 sidecar fetches** — the Range path fetches one `poems/{b}.idx.json` per visited bucket (cached).
  Negligible in practice; collapse into a single index if it ever matters (see TODO 3).

### Locked decisions (don't relitigate without reason)
- **Default = random (Babel) generation; no further self-built 平仄 research** — the 格律
  product engine + the charlesix59 平水韵 data cover it. "Good poems" = real-corpus search;
  neural generation needs a backend (conflicts with static) — deferred.
- **Simplified** is canonical (corpus = index = search script; no OpenCC at runtime).
- **Index convention: first char = most-significant digit.**
- **Filters compose inside one Babel catalog**; the displayed 全集编号 is always the full-catalog
  address.
